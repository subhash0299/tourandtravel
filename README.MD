# 🌍 Tour and Travel Website

This is a fully responsive **Tour and Travel Website** built with **ReactJS**, **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It simulates the functionality of real-world travel platforms like MakeMyTrip or Booking.com, showing tours, flight, and bus booking options — all using hardcoded data on the backend.

## 🚀 Features

- ✈️ Flight booking UI
- 🚌 Bus ticket booking UI
- 🌄 Popular travel destinations
- 🔎 Search functionality (UI-based)
- 📱 Responsive design for all screen sizes

> **Note:** This is a front-end focused project — no real-time API or backend integration. All data is hardcoded to mimic real applications.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **ReactJS**
- **TypeScript**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **Responsive CSS / Flexbox / Grid**
